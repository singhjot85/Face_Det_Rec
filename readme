This python script uses a haar-cascade classifier for face detection

You can also use pre-saved photo/video in this script and can also use
webcam or any other device.

The scipt detect face and draws a rectangle around detected face in live
video, if it matches any of the faces in the database it also shows name
of the person.
Database: To be custom built with image_name as name of person.

This script also uses caching to save time, i.e. people who are in database
their face_encodings are cached in pkl file.
cache_file: face_encodings_cache.pkl

Include the Face database in same folder/directory as the main script.
